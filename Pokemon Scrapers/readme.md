Scraping for Pokemon
--------------------
These are a couple of files that deal with scraping for Pokemon data online.

"Pokemon Image Scraper.ipynb" scrapes for Pokemon images on Serebii.

"Pokedex Scraper.ipynb" scrapes for Pokedex data include Names, Types, Abilities, and Pokedex text from PokemonDB.

I have written a short blogpost on these files here: https://medium.com/@jsw.tan1991/creating-a-pokedex-with-selenium-scraping-53d3cdf3db51
