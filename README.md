# The-Planetary-Datalinks

These are projects that I have been since early 2021. They represent my progress learning the ins and outs of Python as I move from topic to topic. In a sense, this repository is for me to track my own accomplishments, be they good or mediocre. The most important thing about it is that I make sure that I record what I've been doing.

Overall, this is a series of fun projects for me. They are certainly not the best projects out there, and I'm certainly not the best programmer. I am having fun though, I do want to continue having fun by recording my progress, so that in 5-10 years I can look back and laugh about it.
